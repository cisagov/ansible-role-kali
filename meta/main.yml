  # With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
  # identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
  # OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
  # Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
  # 2.10 or newer.
  min_ansible_version: 2.10
  # There is an empty platforms key because Kali linux isn't an option
  # for it.  Even though Kali is based on Debian Testing
  # (https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian),
  # we are installing a lot of Kali-specific packages in this role.
  #
  # The Ansible linter does not allow an empty platforms key, so the
  # noqa 701 is required here.

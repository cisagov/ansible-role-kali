  # There is an empty platforms key because Kali linux isn't an option
  # for it.  Even though Kali is based on Debian Testing
  # (https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian),
  # we are installing a lot of Kali-specific packages in this role.
  #
  # The Ansible linter does not allow an empty platforms key, so the
  # noqa 701 is required here.
